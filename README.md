# PyScare V1.0
Grabs a bunch of your details (ripped from my [UltimateGrabber](https://github.com/MightySpaceman/UltimateGrabber) project) and sets it as your desktop background, as well as a note from 'anonymous'. Can be run as [EXE](https://github.com/MightySpaceman/PyScare/releases/latest) so that you do not need python installed on the host machine - fun for trolling people...

You can change the cover icon of the EXE using a tool such as [Resource Hacker](http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/#download) if you please.

Example:

(I have replaced a few details so as to not...you know...leak my IP)
